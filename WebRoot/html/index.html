            <p>W3Schools is a freemium educational website for learning coding online. Initially released in 1998, it
                derives its name from the World Wide Web but is not affiliated with the W3 Consortium.[3][4] W3Schools
                offers courses covering all aspects of web development.[ W3Schools also publishes free HTML templates.
                It is run by Refsnes Data in Norway. It has an online text editor called TryIt Editor, and readers can
                edit examples and run the code in a test environment.</p><br />

            <p>HackerRank is a tech company that focuses on competitive programming challenges for both consumers and
                businesses. Developers compete by writing programs according to provided specifications. HackerRank's
                programming challenges can be solved in a variety of programming languages (including Java, C++, PHP,
                Python, SQL, JavaScript) and span multiple computer science domains.

                HackerRank categorizes most of their programming challenges into a number of core computer science
                domains, including the management of databases, mathematics, artificial intelligence, among other
                subjects.

                When a programmer submits a solution to a programming challenge, their submission is scored on the
                accuracy of their output. Programmers are then ranked globally on the HackerRank leaderboard and earn
                badges based on their accomplishments, which is intended to drive competition among users. In addition
                to individual coding challenges, HackerRank also hosts contests (often referred to by HackerRank as
                "CodeSprints") where users compete on the same programming challenges during a set period of time and
                are then ranked at the conclusion of the event. HackerRank is part of the growing gamification trend
                within competitive computer programming. The consumer-side of their website is free for coders to use.

            <p>CodePen is an online community for testing and showcasing user-created HTML, CSS and JavaScript code
                snippets. It functions as an online code editor and open-source learning environment, where developers
                can create code snippets, called "pens," and test them. It was founded in 2012 by full-stack developers
                Alex Vazquez and Tim Sabat and front-end designer Chris Coyier. Its employees work remotely, rarely all
                meeting together in person. CodePen is a large community for web designers and developers to showcase
                their coding skills, with an estimated registered users and 14.16 million monthly visitors.</p><br />
